In addition to supporting healthcare for 55 million Americans, Medicare also uses data and payments to understand and improve patient care. But for the 1.2 million clinicians providing care, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) employees running Medicare, the outdated technology is difficult to use. Working with CMS, the U.S. Digital Service team at HHS is redesigning and upgrading the technology infrastructure and user experience, to provide patients and clinicians with a better system.
